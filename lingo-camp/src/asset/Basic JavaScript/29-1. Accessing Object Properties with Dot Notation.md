There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (`.`) and bracket notation (`[]`), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (`.`) to read an object's property:

```js
let myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};
let prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
let prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2
```

------

Read in the property values of `testObj` using dot notation. Set the variable `hatValue` equal to the object's property `hat` and set the variable `shirtValue` equal to the object's property `shirt`.

```js
// Setup
let testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats"
};

// Only change code below this line

let hatValue = testObj;      // Change this line
let shirtValue = testObj;    // Change this line
```
