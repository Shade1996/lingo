Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

```js
let dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
};
let myDog = "Hunter";
let myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"
```

Another way you can use this concept is when the property's name is collected dynamically during the program execution, as follows:

```js
let someObj = {
  propName: "John"
};
function propPrefix(str) {
  let s = "prop";
  return s + str;
}
let someProp = propPrefix("Name"); // someProp now holds the value 'propName'
console.log(someObj[someProp]); // "John"
```

Note that we do *not* use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the *value* of the variable, not the *name*.

------

Set the `playerNumber` variable to `16`. Then, use the variable to look up the player's name and assign it to `player`.

```js
// Setup
let testObj = {
  12: "Namath",
  16: "Montana",
  19: "Unitas"
};

// Only change code below this line

let playerNumber;       // Change this line
let player = testObj;   // Change this line
```
