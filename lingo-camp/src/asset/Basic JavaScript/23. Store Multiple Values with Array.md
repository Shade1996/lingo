With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

`let sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"]`.

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

```js
[["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]
```

This is also called a multi-dimensional array.



We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of `0`.



**Example**

```js
let array = [50,60,70];
array[0]; // equals 50
let data = array[1];  // equals 60
```

**Note**
There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like `array [0]`. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

----

Create a variable called `myData` and set it to equal the first value of `myArray` using bracket notation.

```js
// Setup
let myArray = [50,60,70];

// Only change code below this line
let myData =myArray
```
