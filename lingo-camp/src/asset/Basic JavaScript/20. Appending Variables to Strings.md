Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (`+=`) operator.

Example:

```js
let anAdjective = "awesome!";
let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
// ourStr is now "freeCodeCamp is awesome!"
```

------

Set `someAdjective` to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to `myStr` using the `+=` operator.


```js
// Change code below this line

let someAdjective;
let myStr = "Learning to code is ";
```
