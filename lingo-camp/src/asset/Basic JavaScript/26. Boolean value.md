## Understanding Boolean Values

Another data type is the Boolean. `Booleans` may only be one of two values: `true` or `false`. They are basically little on-off switches, where `true` is "on" and `false` is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.

**Note**
`Boolean` values are never written with quotes. The `strings` `"true"` and `"false"` are not `Boolean` and have no special meaning in JavaScript.





```js
// Setup
function testNotEqual(val) {
  if (val) { // Change this line
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  return "Equal";
}

testNotEqual(10);
```



## Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator

The strict inequality operator (`!==`) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns `false` where strict equality would return `true` and *vice versa*. Strict inequality will not convert data types.

**Examples**

```js
3 !==  3   // false
3 !== '3'  // true
4 !==  3   // true
```



## Comparison with the Greater Than Operator

The greater than operator (`>`) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Like the equality operator, greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

**Examples**

```js
5   >  3   // true
7   > '3'  // true
2   >  3   // false
'1' >  9   // false
```



## Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator

The greater than or equal to operator (`>=`) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Like the equality operator, `greater than or equal to` operator will convert data types while comparing.

**Examples**

```js
6   >=  6   // true
7   >= '3'  // true
2   >=  3   // false
'7' >=  9   // false
```



## Comparison with the Less Than Operator

The less than operator (`<`) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.

**Examples**

```js
2   < 5  // true
'3' < 7  // true
5   < 5  // false
3   < 2  // false
'8' < 4  // false
```



## Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator

The less than or equal to operator (`<=`) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns `true`. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns `false`. Like the equality operator, `less than or equal to` converts data types.

**Examples**

```js
4   <= 5  // true
'7' <= 7  // true
5   <= 5  // true
3   <= 2  // false
'8' <= 4  // false
```
