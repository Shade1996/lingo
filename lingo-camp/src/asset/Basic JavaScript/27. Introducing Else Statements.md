When a condition for an `if` statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an `else` statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.

```js
if (num > 10) {
  return "Bigger than 10";
} else {
  return "10 or Less";
}
```

## Introducing Else If Statements

If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain `if` statements together with `else if` statements.

```js
if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
```

## Logical Order in If Else Statements

Order is important in `if`, `else if` statements.

The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.

Take these two functions as an example.

Here's the first:

```js
function foo(x) {
  if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
```

And the second just switches the order of the statements:

```js
function bar(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
```

While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.

```js
foo(0) // "Less than one"
bar(0) // "Less than two"
```

------

Change the order of logic in the function so that it will return the correct statements in all cases.

```js
function orderMyLogic(val) {
  if (val < 10) {
    return "Less than 10";
  } else if (val < 5) {
    return "Less than 5";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to 10";
  }
}

orderMyLogic(7);
```
