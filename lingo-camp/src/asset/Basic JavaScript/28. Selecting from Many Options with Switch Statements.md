If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A `switch` statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched `case` value until a `break` is encountered.

Here is an example of a `switch` statement:

```js
switch(lowercaseLetter) {
  case "a":
    console.log("A");
    break;
  case "b":
    console.log("B");
    break;
}
```

`case` values are tested with strict equality (`===`). The `break` tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the `break` is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

------

Write a switch statement which tests `val` and sets `answer` for the following conditions:
`1` - "alpha"
`2` - "beta"
`3` - "gamma"
`4` - "delta"



```js
function caseInSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line

if (val === 1)
  answer = "alpha"
else if (val === 2)
  answer = "beta"
else if (val === 3)
  answer = "gamma"
else if (val === 4)
  answer = "delta"

switch(val) {
  case 1:
    answer = "alpha"
    break;
  case 2:
    answer = "beta"
    break;
  case 3:
    answer = "gamma"
    break;
  case 4:
    answer = "delta"
    break;
}


  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);
```
