In JavaScript, when the `+` operator is used with a `String` value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

**Example**

```js
'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
```

**Note**
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

```js
let ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
// ourStr is "I come first. I come second."
```

------

Build `myStr` from the strings `"This is the start. "` and `"This is the end."` using the `+` operator.

```js
let myStr; // Change this line
```
